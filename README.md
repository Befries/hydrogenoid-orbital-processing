# Hydrogenoidal Orbital with Processing 4

Generating hydrogenoid orbital using processing 4 based on the introduction to quantum physics course
for the second year in the Brussels schools of engineering (ULB).

The quantum numbers n, l, m and the charge Z can be modify directly in the source code.
As you are vizualising equiprobable surfaces, you can modify the cursor to set what is the value of probability density you wanna keep.

The program tests a set of points and only keeps those who follow the cursor to an epsilon (wich you can change)
the set of points is iterated throughout, with a step in the colatitude (thetaStep) or in the radius (rStep) or longitude (phiStep)
the radius test extends to rMax.
